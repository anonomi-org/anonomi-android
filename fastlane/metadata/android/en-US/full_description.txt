Anonomi Messenger is a privacy-first communication tool designed for situations where networks are monitored, infrastructure is hostile, and trust assumptions fail.

It is built for people who cannot afford to be naive about surveillance, centralization, or metadata.

Features:

* Secure messaging — Peer-to-peer communication with no central servers to seize or subpoena.
* Tor support (online mode) — Route traffic through Tor, with bridge support when Tor is blocked.
* Offline operation — Communicate without the internet using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or external storage (store-and-forward).
* Private payments (Monero) — In-chat payment requests using unique subaddresses to avoid persistent identifiers.
* Offline maps & location sharing — Share locations and navigate using imported map tiles, no external map servers.

Philosophy:

* Anti-authoritarian by design — Incompatible with centralized control, mass surveillance, and coercive platforms.
* Open and auditable — Security through transparency, not marketing claims.
* Community-governed — No sponsors, no investors, no institutional control.
* Honest about limits — Trade-offs are documented. Assumptions are explicit.

Android only. iOS is intentionally not supported due to architectural and policy constraints that prevent the level of network control, offline operation, and user agency required by the threat model.

Privacy is a condition you defend, not a checkbox you enable.
